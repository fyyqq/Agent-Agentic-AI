# Plan for Creating index.py

## Objective
Create an index.py file in the current directory (c:/Users/2Stallions/OneDrive/Desktop/AI/AI Agent & Agentic AI)

## Steps
1. Create a basic Python file structure for index.py
2. Include a main function as entry point
3. Add basic documentation

## File Content
The index.py file should contain:
- A proper shebang line for Python execution
- Basic documentation
- A main function that serves as the entry point
- A simple print statement to verify functionality

## Next Steps
Switch to Code mode to implement the actual Python file.
